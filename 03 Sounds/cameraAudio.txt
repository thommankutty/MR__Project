Each camera provides features such as a full frame shutter and electronic exposure time control.
Exposure start, exposure time, and charge readout can be controlled by parameters transmitted to the camera via the Bassler pylon API and the GigE interface. 
There are also parameters available to set the camera for single frame acquisition or continuous frame acquisition. 
Exposure start can also be controlled via an externally generated hardware trigger (ExTrig) signal. 
The ExTrig signal facilitates periodic or non-periodic acquisition start. Modes are available that allow the length of exposure time to be directly controlled by the ExTrig signal or to be set for a pre-programmed period of time
